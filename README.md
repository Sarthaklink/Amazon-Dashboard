## Documentation

**1. Executive Summary:**
The "Amazon Sales Analysis" dashboard, constructed using Microsoft Power BI, is a sophisticated visualization project aimed at providing a compelling and informative representation of sales data for over 1400+ products on the Amazon platform. Through skilful employment of Power BI's capabilities, this project endeavours to deliver a visually captivating dashboard that brings to light critical insights related to total sales, discounted sales, revenue distribution across categories and sub-categories, along with the identification of top-rated and best-selling products. The integration of slicers for category and sub-category filtering augments user interactivity, enhancing the analytical experience.

**2. Introduction:**
E-commerce platforms like Amazon generate immense volumes of sales data, and the efficient extraction of meaningful insights from such data can greatly influence business strategies. This project centres on leveraging Power BI's prowess to create a dashboard that not only aggregates and presents sales data but also facilitates dynamic exploration, aiding stakeholders in understanding sales trends and patterns.

**3. Methodology:**
The construction of the Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard was grounded in a methodical approach. The primary data source is the sales dataset containing information about more than 1400+ products. Data pre-processing encompassed data cleansing, transformation, and enrichment to ensure data quality and accuracy. Power BI's ETL capabilities were harnessed for these tasks.

**4. Dashboard Components:**

**4.1 Total Sales and Discounted Sales Radial Gauge Meter:**
The centrepiece of the dashboard is a visually impactful Radial gauge meter. It elegantly visualizes the total sales figure, while a supplementary gauge showcases the percentage of sales that occurred at discounted prices. This component offers an immediate overview of sales performance and the effectiveness of discounts.

**4.2 Category and Sub-Category Revenue Bar Chart:**
This bar chart segment illustrates the revenue distribution across various product categories and their corresponding sub-categories. Each bar represents a category or sub-category, and its height is proportional to the revenue generated. This visualization provides an at-a-glance view of revenue trends, aiding in the identification of top-performing segments.

**4.3 Top-Rated and Best-Selling Product Text Cards:**
Two text cards on the dashboard present critical information about the most highly-rated and best-selling products. These cards dynamically update based on user-selected filters, offering real-time insights into product popularity and customer satisfaction.

**4.4 Category and Sub-Category Slicers:**
Two interactive slicers, one for category and the other for sub-category, grant users the power to focus on specific segments of interest. These slicers facilitate dynamic data filtering, allowing users to instantly observe changes in the visualizations based on their selections.

**5. Key Insights:**
The Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard has yielded several profound insights:

- Clear Sales Performance Metrics: The gauge meters offer an intuitive depiction of total sales and the extent of discounts, providing stakeholders with quick metrics to assess the overall financial performance.
